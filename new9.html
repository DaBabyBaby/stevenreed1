<tr>
<td>Assassins Creed Origins</td>
<td>This is a really fun game that i would really recomend to everybody. The graphics are really good and the story line is amazing. the open world enviroment is awesome. Tho in wouldn't recomend exploring, its very hard to play. It is very historicaly acurate to what i know about the history of Egypt.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Battlefront 2</td>
<td>This game is not a open world enviroment but is still very fun to play. the campaign is really good if you like star wars, there is still a very active comunity but recently the producers of the game decided to stop giving it updates.  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Gaurdians of the Galaxy</td>
<td>I highly recomend this game to everyone ive played thru it 2 times. Yeah its a newer agme there gonna be some bugs but its stil really fun to play with different stuff to find and upgrade.</td>
